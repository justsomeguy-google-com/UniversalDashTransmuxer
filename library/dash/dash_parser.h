// Main interface for a DASH parser.  Can parse any DASH box containing
// other boxes and will recurse to create additional DashParser's as
// needed.
//
// You can load as much DASH content as you want.  The more you load the
// more RAM you will need.  Future versions of the DashParser will allow
// processing on the DOM in a way that allows reloading of data as needed.
// In practical use it is irrelevant because only the first 1-2K needs to be
// parsed to get the sidx.  From the sidx only individually segments would ever
// be loaded.  These segments tend to be 3-10 seconds of video.
//
// DashParser includes routines to diagnose DASH content.
//
// Example:
//   DashParser parser;
//   parser.Parse(GetDashContents());
//   SidxContents* parser.GetBoxContents(kType_sidx);
//
// Defensive coding:
// The DashParser does its best to make sure entire boxes are parsed at once.
// This removes the vast majority of buffer overruns.  The DashParser does
// not have knowledge of the internal structure of boxes, however, so each
// box should use EnoughBytesToParse before reading the internal box.
//
// Any Parse that returns 0 bytes is by definition a failure and should be
// treated as aborting parsing.
//
// Diagnostic tools can ignore the 0 returned by a BoxContent as the length
// of the box should let the parser continue on to the next box.  Regular media
// should just abort.
