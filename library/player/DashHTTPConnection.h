// Proxy connection for handling one movie.
//
// Uses static variables so multiple DashHTTPConnections will use the same
// DashParsers.  To simplify readability of this example very little error
// detection is done.  In production code the error handling must be
// included.
//
// The included sample asset is truncated.  iOS does not like that so this
// example returns only the first 15 seconds.  Productions code should
// return the entire contents.
//
// Absolutely requires ParseAudio/ParseVideo to be called before Convert.
//
// This example uses amazingly trivial manifests.  No adaption, no audio
// only cellular acceptable sessions, no alternate languages.  Just pure
// simple trivial manifest.
